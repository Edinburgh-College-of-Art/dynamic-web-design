As soon as your team has been created, you should get together and choose one of these briefs as a starting point for your project. You will then need quickly to develop your ideas about your design in response to this.

## INCLUSION

### Develop a method of gathering and displaying demographic data in an inclusive and identity positive way.

Pick an organisation that works with people from a broad range of backgrounds â€“ this can be social, political, (sub)cultural, commercial, etc. Your goal is to create a tool to gather and display information about their users in a way that doesn't alienate anyone. The means of collecting the data is as important as how you present it.

How can you capture and present user data that celebrates the many and varied characteristics of the people that engage with this organisation? What questions will you ask, and how? What methods will you use to store, query, display and compare this data?

## EDUCATION

### Develop a method of exploring an archive or collection in a way that enhances understanding and encourages learning.

Pick an organisation with links to education such as a library, museum, school, wildlife reserve, journal, etc. Your goal is to create an interactive learning tool for the organisation. Your target audience will be a specific group of users within the organisation's demographic (eg, children attending a wildlife reserve, design students accessing the university library).

What learning-based questions might your target audience ask this organisation? How can you categorise these? How will you enable them to ask questions, then present them with insightful results that inspire them to explore further?
