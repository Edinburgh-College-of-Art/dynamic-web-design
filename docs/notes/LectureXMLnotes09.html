  <p>The focus of this lecture is on information,  how to present it through
    the Web, and also how to package and transmit it between applications.. </p> 
  <p>When we think about presenting information, it seems intuitively plausible
    that we can draw a distinction between <i>what</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> the information is that 's being presented, and on
    the other hand </span><i>how</i><span style='font-style:normal'> it's being
    presented. Another way of thinking of this is that we can distinguish the
    substance or content of the information from the form in which it's expressed.
    These intuitions are the basis of many of the approaches to information presentation
    on the World Wide Web, and in particular of the rapidly expanding use of
    XML. In this lecture, we look at a few of the basic techniques available
    in this area.</span></p> 
  <h1><b>HTML</b></h1> 
  <p>HTML (the &quot;HyperText Markup Language&quot;) is historically part of
    a sustained effort to develop a way of describing the form of documents (&quot;marking
    them up&quot;) in a way that would be standardised and facilitate their exchange
  between people and computer systems.</p>
  <p>Researchers tried a considerable range
    of approaches, often based initially on traditional concepts such as &quot;title&quot;, &quot;section&quot;, &quot;subsection&quot;, &quot;paragraph&quot;,
    etc. It was realised that a good deal of flexibility was going to be required
    to cover the huge range of existing and possible future types of document.
    This resulted in a very general solution: the Standard General Markup Language
    (SGML). Modern markup languages like HTML are ultimately derived from this.</p>
  <p>In some sense, HTML has the effect of treating a document as a kind of data.
    It contains specific tags that identifiy text features that we usually see
    as fairly intuitive: headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, etc.&nbsp;These
    are aspects of the <em>structure</em> of the document, that are somewhat
    independent from the content in it.We are already used to the idea that the
    way these things appear (are formatted) can change, and can be controlled
    via Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS allows us to define styling information
    for specific tags, and include this with the &quot;vanilla&quot; HTML
    so that the way these tags are interpreted is changed globally.</p>
  <p>So the data (the text) is structured and presented through a system that
    marks it up and allows us to specify what kinds of things it contains and
    how we want to see them displayed.</p>
<h1>XML  </h1>
  <p>A problem with HTML, even with this elaborated styling mechanism, is that
    the objective of the markup is to control the <i>appearance</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> of a document, the way text is laid out and presented,
    not the structure of the <em>information</em> (the content) that it contains,
which is whatever the text is <em>about</em>. </span></p>
  <p><span
style='font-style:normal'>But often, the latter is much more useful.
    If we can mark up the content and then as a completely separate step define
    different ways for this to appear, we will have a much more flexible system.
</span></p>
  <p><span
style='font-style:normal'>The </span><i>Extensible
    Markup Language</i><span style='font-style:normal'> (XML)
    is fundamentally a way of defining our own tags, which are meaningful to
    us in terms of some particular kind of information we are interested in.
    There is then also a system (actually, a number of alternative systems) that
    will let us transform these tags into normal HTML as understood by browsers,
so that we can present the information however we want (if we want to present
it at all</span> -- as we'll see, XML is intended for many other purposes than
this).</p> 
  <p>XML  can be used to define documents of endless varieties, as a
    sort of elaborated form of HTML, including special kinds of paragraphs, lists
    etc. HTML itself is now defined by the W3C in terms of XML, and very often
the two are closely integrated. </p>
  <p>XHTML, as
    commonly used with CSS, is really an extended set of HTML tags, defined using
    XML,  which allows a more refined control of appearance without altering
    the content. </p>
  <p>Systems that work with HTML that isn't expected to be human-readable
    often get very complicated about the integration. As an example of this,
    the following comes from the source of an
    old version of these notes, which is HTML produced from MS Word:</p>

  <p>-- the complexity of this HTML and the amount of embedded XML information
  is very striking! Most of the material is <em>metadata</em> about the nature
  of the matrerial in the document, which is something else we'll come back to. </p>
  <p>We will not be looking any further at text document markup here, but will
    focus more on the use of XML for marking up <i>general data</i><span style='font-style:
normal'> that may be about any kind of items. We want to be able to identify
    the items and their attributes before we consider any issues about how to
    process or present this data, and this is where XML turns out to be ideal.</span></p>
  <p>Suppose we have some information about a collection of building products,
    similar to the ones considered in the ColdFusion examples earlier. The following
    is a possible way to mark this up.</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;productDB&gt;<br>
  &lt;product&gt;<br>
  &lt;manuf URL=&quot;http://www.wilkins.com&quot;&gt;Wilkins doors&lt;/manuf&gt;<br>
  &lt;name type=&quot;door&quot;&gt;Superdoor&lt;/name&gt;<br>
&lt;description&gt;Excellent sound insulation properties.&nbsp; Lightweight.&lt;/description&gt;<br>
&lt;price&gt;87.43&lt;/price&gt;<br>
&lt;/product&gt;<br>
&lt;product&gt;<br>
&lt;manuf URL=&quot;http://www.fenester.com&quot;&gt;Fenester
  plc&lt;/manuf&gt;<br>
&lt;name type=&quot;window&quot;&gt;Ultra Sash&lt;/name&gt;<br>
&lt;description&gt;Double glazed.&nbsp; Smooth action.&lt;/description&gt;<br>
&lt;price&gt;123.41&lt;/price&gt;<br>
&lt;/product&gt;<br>
&lt;product&gt;<br>
&lt;manuf&gt;Lights Unlimited&lt;/manuf&gt;<br>
&lt;name type=&quot;lighting&quot;&gt;Track spot 43&lt;/name&gt;<br>
&lt;price&gt;21.99&lt;/price&gt;<br>
&lt;/product&gt;<br>
&lt;/productDB&gt;</p>
  <p>This is a database of products (<span class="codejl">productDB</span>),
    containing at present only 3 items (<span class="codejl">product</span>),
    about each of which we have information such as the manufacturer (<span class="codejl">manuf</span>),
    name of the product, a description and a price. In addition, some of these
    tags have <i>attributes</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>: the manufacturer has (optionally) a URL, and the
    name has a type. </span></p>
  <p><span
style='font-style:normal'>It is entirely up to us how we organise these things.
      We can have other tags, and we can have whatever attributes we like. (The
      structure here isn't necessarily a good structure, of course — it's just for the sake
    of an example.) </span></p>
  <p><span
style='font-style:normal'>It would be good to make sure that we use these things
      consistently, however, and especially if the database gets at all large
      then it would be nice to have this consistency checked automatically. </span></p>
  <p><span
style='font-style:normal'>With
    XML, that's easy, because we can create a Document Type Definition (DTD).
    The DTD simply defines a set of tags and attributes, and says how they
    can be used. </span></p>
  <p><span
style='font-style:normal'>Whenever an XML file is read, it will be </span><i>parsed</i><span style='font-style:
normal'>, and if the parser is a </span><i>validating parser</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> it will check against the DTD so see if the tags are
    used as the DTD says.&nbsp; If they are not, an XML error message will
    be generated.&nbsp; Here's a DTD for the XML above (<a href="products-bare.xml" target="_blank">products-bare.xml</a>).</span></p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;!DOCTYPE productDB [<br>
  &lt;!ELEMENT productDB (product)* &gt;<br>
  &lt;!ELEMENT product (manuf,name,description?,price?) &gt;<br>
  &lt;!ELEMENT manuf
  (#PCDATA) &gt;<br>
  &lt;!ATTLIST manuf URL NMTOKEN #IMPLIED&gt;<br>
  &lt;!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA) &gt;<br>
  &lt;!ATTLIST name type (door|window|flooring|lighting|furniture)
  #REQUIRED&gt;<br>
  &lt;!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA) &gt;<br>
  &lt;!ELEMENT price (#PCDATA) &gt;<br>]&gt;</p> 
  <p>This looks more complicated than it really is (!). All it says is that a
    productDB consists of an arbitrary number of products, each of which has
    a manufacturer and a name, and <em>optionally</em> a description and a price. The
    manufacturer may have a URL attribute, and the name must have a type, which
    has to be one of the things listed. Nothing much is said about what can be
    entered as the description or price (they're just &quot;parsed character
    data&quot; — PCDATA), but further requirements could be placed on these if
    we wanted. However, simple though it is, this already specifies quite usefully
    the structure of what can count as part of our product database.</p> 
  <p>Now we want to display (or <i>style</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>) the data. One possibility is simply to use CSS again.
      CSS will allow us to define styles for any tags, so we could have, e.g.:</span></p> 
  <p class=codejl>productDB{ display: block;<br>
  margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;<br>
  background-color: rgb(150, 150, 256);<br>
  font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold;<br>
  font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
  }<br>
  product{ display:&nbsp; block;<br>
  font-size: 80%; color: blue<br>
  }<br>
  manuf{ display:block;<br>
  font-size: 80%; font-style: italic; color: red<br>
  }<br>
  description{ display:block;<br>
  font-size:70%; color:green<br>
  }<br>
  price{<br>
  font-size:75%; color:yellow<br>
  }</p>
  <p>— and include this CSS specification at the head of our XML file, which
    we then use as if it were HTML. This produces the following (see <a
href="products2.css" target="_blank">products2.css</a> and <a href="products2c.xml" target="_blank">products2c.xml</a>):</p> 
  <p><img border=0 width=519 height=286
src="CSS-result.png" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"></p> 
  <p>— which is not ideal, since we have rather little control over e.g. the
    order in which things appear, and the attributes have been ignored.</p> 
  <p>A better option is to use XSL, which is a system specifically developed
    for styling XML files. XSL is quite complicated in general, and embeds a
    powerful programming language which can define elaborate presentations. However,
    for practical purposes it can be used relatively simply.</p>
<p> XSL is processed
    by a system known as XSLT, versions of which are conveniently implemented
    in most modern browsers (though there are also many XSLT implementations
    that can be used at the server side, e.g. in ColdFusion  — see discussion
    later).</p>
  <p> XSLT can be given XSL stylesheets <i>to transform any XML structure
    into any other</i><span style='font-style:normal'>. Since HTML is also an
    XML structure, XSLT will take this XSL stylesheet and use it to transform
    the original XML into an HTML output. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xsl_transformation.asp" target="_blank">Here</a> is
  a simple example from an external website.</p>
<p>Despite the power, broad cross-platform support, and relative ease of use
    of browser-based XML styling, it still does not seem to be widely exploited
in user-directed systems. This will perhaps change in the future. </p>
  <h2>XML for data exchange </h2>
  <p><span style='color:black'>The major value of XML is as an exchange format
    for transmitting data across networks, and its value arises mainly from
    its being standard. XML itself is not remarkable, but there are a remarkable
    array of tools and software systems now available for processing it and
    making use of it. </span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>Database systems driving web sites directly often
      do not use XML (as we have seen with ColdFusion), because
    it can be quite inefficient to process in comparison with other representations
    of the same data. But if we have to interface with data stored in different
    formats, e.g. text files, or if substantial amounts of data have to be
    transferred somewhere else, XML is an excellent choice.</span></p>
  <p><span style='color:black'>For this reason, most everyday database systems
      (such as Filemaker Pro,  MySQL, MS Access, etc.) nowadays provide automatic
      translation to XML. If the data above is put into Filemaker Pro as a normal
      data table and then extracted as XML, one way of doing that produces the
      following, which should by now be fairly recognisable (</span><a href="products-fp5.xml" target="_blank">products-fp5.xml</a><span
style='color:black'>):</span></p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;FMPDSORESULT xmlns=&quot;http://www.filemaker.com/fmpdsoresult&quot;&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;ERRORCODE&gt;0&lt;/ERRORCODE&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;DATABASE&gt;products.fp5&lt;/DATABASE&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;LAYOUT&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;/LAYOUT&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;ROW MODID=&quot;2&quot; RECORDID=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;manuf&gt;Wilkins doors&lt;/manuf&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;URL&gt;http://www.wilkins.com&lt;/URL&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;name&gt;Superdoor&lt;/name&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;type&gt;door&lt;/type&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;description&gt;Excellent sound insulation properties.&lt;/description&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;price&gt;87.43&lt;/price&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;/ROW&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;ROW MODID=&quot;0&quot; RECORDID=&quot;2&quot;&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;manuf&gt;Fenester plc&lt;/manuf&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;URL&gt;http://www.fenester.com&lt;/URL&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;name&gt;Ultra Sash&lt;/name&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;type&gt;window&lt;/type&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;description&gt;Double glazed. Smooth action.&lt;/description&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;price&gt;123.41&lt;/price&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;/ROW&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;ROW MODID=&quot;0&quot; RECORDID=&quot;3&quot;&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;manuf&gt;Lights Unlimited&lt;/manuf&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;URL&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;/URL&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;name&gt;Track spot 43&lt;/name&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;type&gt;lighting&lt;/type&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;description&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;/description&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;price&gt;21.99&lt;/price&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;/ROW&gt;</p> 
  <p class=codejl>&lt;/FMPDSORESULT&gt;</p> 
  <p>Some things to note here are that there are no attributes of the field tags
    (which have here been made into separate fields, unlike in our original form
    of the example), and that each record has to contain each field tag, even
    if there is no data for that field. This is thus a stricter set of conditions
    on the XML, which respect the typical structure of relational databases.
    Also some general information and the ROW and FMPDSORESULT tags have been
    added. Hence, this XML is now well structured for import into some other
    suitable database (possibly, as is provided for in FMP, after further transformations
    with XSL stylesheets — it would be easy for instance to transform this XML
    into the original XML product data that we had above).</p> 
  <p style='
text-autospace:none'>This kind of technique can be used to exchange data between
    different databases on different servers, and is potentially very powerful
    in conjunction with the ability of many database-oriented systems to <i>serialise</i><span style='font-style:normal'> data.
    Data serialisation means turning it into a string which can then be easily
    communicated across a network. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-style:normal'>Here, XML comes into its
      own. A standard format known as WDDX is used to serialise data from arbitrary
      databases, and then it can be sent somewhere else and deserialised before
      being used directly to update another database. The WDDX format is somewhat
      obscure, so I have not serialised the data above, but it would not be difficult
      in principle. </span>You can find a discussion of this in the O'Reilly ColdFusion book. </p> 
<h1>XML processing with ColdFusion</h1> 
  <p>ColdFusion has very advanced features for handling
    XML data, aside from the serialisation just mentioned. It can read, parse,
    create, transform and style XML in many diverse ways, including applying
    XSL stylesheets. This means that in principle if you are doing anything with
    XML you can do it at the server side, and not assume anything about the user’s
    browser’s
    ability to style XML at all. (Similar functions are provided by most other
    server-side processing systems, such as PHP. ) We'll mention this again once
    we've seen the more basic features of ColdFusion.</p> 
  <p>There is a good introduction to XML in ColdFusion, though quite terse and
    not always easy going (originally from the Macromedia developer centre),
    installed at <a
href="http://webdbdev.ucs.ed.ac.uk/ddm/XmlExampleCode/xmlxslt.pdf" target="_blank">http://webdbdev.ucs.ed.ac.uk/ddm/2009/XmlExampleCode/xmlxslt.pdf</a>,
    with the code examples discussed in that text being available in the same
    directory. As usual, you can copy and paste these into your own templates
  elsewhere.</p>
  <p>But more important than XSLT applications is the use of XML for broader
    web applications, as we will now see.</p> 
  <h1>Why is XML really becoming such a buzzword?</h1> 
  <p>Probably the best answer to this question is: <i>Web Services</i>. Web
      services are arbitrary elements of functionality that developers can make
      available on the web for use in applications created by other developers.
      They are fast becoming a central feature of e-commerce systems. You can
      find directories of them, e.g. at <a
href="http://www.xmethods.net/" target="_blank">http://www.xmethods.net/</a>.
      These will let you do all kinds of things, and ColdFusion is a very simple
    system in which to access them. </p>
  <p>Web services generally
    operate using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which is an XML format.
    Web services are described using the Web Services Description Language (WSDL),
    which is also an XML format. Another well known case is Really Simple Syndication
    (RSS): RSS &quot;feeds&quot; are just XML pages that regularly update, with
    outline information in a simple repeating structure. Among
    many other possible examples, Amazon.com provides a comprehensive set of
    web services which allow other web sites to include Amazon functions, searches,
    information, etc. (without it necessarily being obvious that these services
have come from Amazon) — see <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/webservices/" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/webservices/</a>.    </p>
  <p>This kind of service is already leading towards the web becoming an integrated
    network of applications that join relatively seamlessly together in complex
    ways that the typical user is entirely unaware of. Many are free, but also
    access to web services can be bought and sold; there are systems for charging,
    etc. This is a good example of <b>B2B</b> (i.e.
    business-to-business) e-commerce. Most web services use XML as an interchange
    format for the information that forms the basis of the service. XML is clearly
    emerging as the standard syntax in which the billions of communications required
    for global commerce will be framed in the coming decades.</p>
