## Introduction

The Dynamic Web Design course basically requires you to work with a team of two other students to build (design and develop) a complete, working dynamic web site within 11 weeks. This is challenging, especially if you have done nothing like it before. One key to success is to work steadily, accumulating progress every week, ideally every day, and not just working in bursts before the submission dates. To help with this, we have identified a set of key elements of a good site, which we require your site to include. These will be developed during the course and will act as regular small interim submissions that guide your work and help to keep it on track. 

Another critical key to success is that your team works effectively together: everyone pulls their weight, while everyone helps and supports each other and learns from and with each other. In this course, you stand or fall as a team, and your individual success depends on the success of your team. So it's important that each member of the team is included and makes a contribution to each of the steps discussed below. Eventually, the team will have to explain and account for how the individuals have worked together.

## Compulsory figures

At one time, in ice-skating competitions, there used to be a specific list of "figures" (loops, jumps, spins, etc.) that each skater had to include somewhere in their routine. The skater would be marked on the technical quality of their figures, but also, and equally importantly, on the "artistic interpretation" of the whole routine. We borrow these concepts. There are certain specific elements that your site must contain --- the compulsory figures --- and you should do these as well as possible, but in the end they have to come together as elements in a harmonious and effective design for the whole site. How they fit together and how you use them is as important as how well done they are in themselves. Some of the elements are very much about the technology while others are more focused on design.

The course is structured around these elements, in that we will cover the background and techniques necessary for them in turn, and we will expect your team to deliver a specimen implementation of each one. Meanwhile, you should also be working out creative, imaginative and appropriate ways of integrating them into your overall site design. An important aspect of these elements is that they are relatively simple, but all can be used in more sophisticated ways if you develop the ideas and techniques further.

The following list outlines the "compulsory figures" we will be using, and the time schedule for delivering them. In each case, there will be an existing skeleton implementation that will be presented in a lecture or viewtorial (or both), and making that work in your site will be the minimal way to deliver the task. This might take anything from minutes to hours, depending on the existing level of skill in your team and how quickly you learn, but we have our own team of skilled and experienced tutors on hand to help you with any problems you encounter.

### Database + form (SimpleExample)

The course starts with a "Simple Example" that demonstrates setting up a database on the server, and getting information into it and out again using HTML forms and templates. Making this work is the first task, which your team must achieve by the end of week 2.

### Simple case of AJAX

*AJAX* is a technique (Asynchronous Javascript And XML) that offers a more flexible way of relating the front end and back end of your web application. We will implement a simple case of this by the end of week 3.

### Simple case of using an API

An *API* (Application Programming Interface) is used to connect different pieces of software together, e.g. when bringing data into your site from a web service provided somewhere else (e.g. weather data, recipes, videos of cats, or whatever). We will address this during week 4.

### Accessibility



Simple case of uploading something safely
Accessibility … (what would this mean?)
- Validity checking?
Responsiveness
CSS aspects of some kind?
— have a clear account of the implementation (how the site works)
Design:
Certain kinds of interactions?  — meaningful interactions — screen real estate: 10 second rule?
Skinning with CSS? (Would interact badly with things like Bootstrap …)
Something that might promote group strengthening as a side-effect?
— have a clear account of the design rationale (why the site is the way it is)
— have made some (documented) effort to incorporate user feedback
