<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dynamic web sites are everywhere. Very few are static HTML
  pages. E-commerce systems are dynamic; catalogues, searches, registration/login
  systems, shopping baskets, message boards, surveys, systems with cookies, RSS
  feeds -- all these are dynamic. We need to understand how to create and control
  them for ourselves. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Dynamic web sites are all about change: change not just in
  the way information is displayed (which we can achieve in the browser with
  Javascript, Flash, etc.), but change in the information itself. Information
  may be dynamically substituted with other information, or dynamically created
  from some other resource. This can only be done at the source of the information:
  the web server. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>So in this course, we begin by turning our focus away from
  the web user's browser for a while, to consider the role of the web <i>server</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> in an interaction, and how we can use this to
    provide for different kinds of functionality. In particular, we look at how
    information can be obtained from the user by means of <em>form-filling</em>,
    and we begin to look at how it can be processed once we've got it. </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span
style='font-style:normal'>We develop
  this line of discussion by starting to look at the use of <em>databases</em> and
  how they can be integrated to provide dynamic information through web sites.
    These are the techniques and technologies used by most commercial web sites,
    and this course should equip you to understand how these are created, and
    develop sites of these kinds for yourself. </span>We will start by considering
    the simplest kinds of web technologies and then move on to look at a system
    called PHP, which we will use in this course as
    our choice from a range of possible technologies with similar capabilities.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>As ever in this programme, we are not aiming to do more in
  the lectures than introduce these things: it is up to you to pursue further
  resources to find more information and move to a more advanced level.</p>
<h2>The role of the server</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you look at a web page, what actually happens is that
your browser connects to a server, specified in the first part of the URL, and
sends the server a <i>request</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, which
includes the whole URL. The server provides (i.e. </span><i>serves</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>) a specific document, specified by the rest of the
URL. </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span
style='font-style:normal'>The document (which is usually just a file full of
    some kind of data) is downloaded onto your machine, and the browser identifies
    its <em><strong>type</strong></em>, usually through information in a “header” sent by the server (see
    below), which normally relates  to the file extension, &quot;.html&quot; etc.
    (but the header often takes precedence if the file extension is different).
    If it's HTML, or plain text, or a few other things, the browser will attempt
    to display it using its own resources; or it may offer it as input to a plugin;
    otherwise it may launch a helper application or just save the file somewhere.
    (Usually browser “preferences” determine how various kinds of document are
    handled; see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type</a>.)</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span
style='font-style:normal'>Sometimes,
    the document requested by the browser does not already exist on the server
    machine, at least not in the required form. In that case, the request may
    fail, but alternatively the server may have been given instructions to do
    some processing to create or modify the document before serving it. </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span
style='font-style:normal'>The HyperText
      Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which web applications typically use to communicate,
      is how requests are expressed when the URL begins with &quot;http:&quot;, and
      it allows one to specify some aspects of how the server should behave. </span></p>
<h2>CGI</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The &quot;Common Gateway Interface&quot; is a standard
mechanism whereby the server can be made to execute some application on the
server machine, and provide any result from the application as data to be sent
back to the originator of the request. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The server will execute the application;
    it will also pass as a <i><strong>parameter</strong></i><span style='font-style:normal'> to the application any
  component of the URL that follows a &quot;<strong>?</strong>&quot; character. Thus, if you visit
  the Google search site (<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/</a>) and execute a search for </span><i>MSc
  Design Digital Media</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, you'll notice
  that the URL in the browser changes to something like the following:</span></p>
<p><code>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=MSc+Design+Digital+Media&amp;btnG=Google+Search</code></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>In this URL, <i>search,</i> just before the &quot;<em>?</em>&quot;, <span style='font-style:normal'>
will be the name of some application on the Google server machine, and the string </span><em>hl=en&amp;q=MSc+Design+Digital+Media&amp;btnG=Google+Search</em> <span style='font-style:normal'>is
what's handed to it as a parameter. </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-style:normal'>By convention, this parameter
    string (often called the &quot;<em>query
  string</em>&quot;) consists of a list
  of named parameters (in this case three: </span><i>h1, q, </i>and<i> btnG</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>) and their values, linked by &quot;=&quot;. The
  parameter-value pairs are separated by &quot;&amp;&quot;. Within parameter
  values, words are separated with the &quot;+&quot; character.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span
style='font-style:normal'>Spaces are not
  allowed: any such non-alphanumeric characters are represented by &quot;%&quot;
  and then their ASCII code as a two-digit hexadecimal number, so if spaces do
  appear they are encoded as &quot;%20&quot;. (This arrangement is called </span><i>URL
  encoding</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, and has to be used in all URLs,
  though many browsers will encode URLs before sending them if you just type
  them in directly.)</span></p>
<h2>The HTTP request methods</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal>When a request is sent to a server, a <i><strong>method</strong></i><span
style='font-style:normal'> is specified for handling any data associated with
    the request. Usually, this is either GET or POST. The former of these is
    notionally associated with getting information from the server, while the
    latter is associated with posting data to it; however these are often not
    very distinct. Either way, some facility is available for the server to obtain
    information from the browser, which may then be somehow processed (and then
    probably other information will be sent back as a response). </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span
style='font-style:normal'>In the case of <em>forms</em>, the browser is in fact
    providing data to the server, but it can do this using either GET or POST
    methods -- the information is simply sent in different ways. We will normally
    use the POST method for form data, because it has some security advantages.</span></p>
<h2>Forms</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>HTML forms are, at their simplest, just a quick and convenient
way of adding information to an HTTP request. For example, they can be used to
  construct a query string for a CGI URL. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Suppose we have an application
    on our server that saves people's names in a file, and the application is
  called <i>namesave.cgi</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>. If one executes it with a name as parameter, it
  will add the name to a file. We could have the user always type in a URL ending
  with</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt; font-size: 14pt;'><span style='font-family:Courier'>.../namesave.cgi?name=John+Smith</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(or whatever their name might be), but this is not at all
convenient. Usually the user would be put off by this, and it is more practical,
  as well as more attractive and simpler, to provide instead an
  HTML form as follows.</p>

<p><code>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;title&gt;Simple example form&lt;/title&gt;<br>
&lt;/head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;h1&gt;An example of a very simple form&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

&lt;p&gt;<br>

&lt;form method=&quot;GET&quot;
action=&quot;namesave.cgi&quot;&gt;<br>

Enter your name here:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><br>

&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;<br>

&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;<br>

&lt;input type=&quot;reset&quot;&gt;<br>

&lt;/form&gt;<br>

&lt;/body&gt;<br>

&lt;/html&gt;<br>
</code><o:p></o:p>
<p class=MsoNormal>When this HTML is displayed, it looks as follows (<a href="http://ddm.caad.ed.ac.uk/lectures/DDM/Intro_Digital_Media/Lecture11/simpleform.html" target="_blank">or

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And when the Submit button is clicked, the URL changes to
the one shown above, i.e. it ends in <em>namesave.cgi</em> (and what comes before
that depends on the URL of the form itself, because in the HTML of the form
<em>action</em> attribute we have used a <em>relative link -- </em>relative and
absolute links work in forms just the same way as anywhere else). [NB, the application
in this example is now a dummy, so you'll get a &quot;permission
denied&quot; message when you try to execute it, but you can still see what happens
to the URL.]</p>
<!--<p class=MsoNormal>(<a href="http://ddm.caad.ed.ac.uk/lectures/DDM/Intro_Digital_Media/Lecture11/listnames.cgi" target="_blank">Access
  this link to see where the input went ...</a>) </p> -->
<p class=MsoNormal>This
  principle can be extended, in that there are a considerable range of types
  of input available (lists, buttons, checkboxes, etc.), and clearly the URL
  produced can become very complicated, but the mechanism remains the same.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Editors such as Dreamweaver make the creation of forms very
simple. The trickier part comes when you want to do something with the data
they create. The basic mechanism is fairly simple: the &quot;form&quot; tag
specifies through its &quot;action&quot; attribute a CGI application that will
be used by the server to process the form data, and the method (GET
or POST) will be as specified by the &quot;method&quot; attribute:</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><code>
&lt;form method=&quot;GET&quot; action=&quot;namesave.cgi&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p class=MsoNormal> All you need
  to do, then, is decide what application to use and create a program that handles
  the data appropriately.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The most obvious difference between GET and POST, in
practice, is that whereas the GET method sends parameters via the URL as
described above, POST causes the information to be sent in a different way,
which is not visible on the URL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have chosen to use GET here for clarity, but obviously POST may have
 advantages in some situations. The application that processes the data
will also have to decode it differently depending on which of these methods is
used, and decoding POST information is more complicated. (With PHP, as we'll
see below, we normally use POST for form data, but we will not need to know the details of how
PHP decodes it.)</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Remember that the URL query string can be used even wihout
  forms, to provide information for an application such as ColdFusion. This will
  continue to be important for us.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>We are concerned here only with the &quot;back-end&quot; processing of form data, but the appearance and behaviour of the form for the user is of course also very important. HTML5 provides many useful features in this respecty and is now the best choice for form development (see the Forms chapter in the excellent <em>Dive into HTML5</em> for explanation and examples — <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/forms.html">http://diveintohtml5.info/forms.html</a>).</p>
<h2>The processing script</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The application program you create to handle form data could
  be almost anything that can be run on the server machine. You could write it
  in C, Java, Prolog, Applescript, Visual Basic, FileMaker Pro or various other
things that might be available. The key factor is that the server runs the application
in an <em>environment</em> where it is provided with the values for various variables
as part of the CGI interface, which includes the query string, along with things
like the user's IP number, the kind of browser they're using, etc.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Often, however, form data is processed by some system that
  is more integrated with the task of producing HTML pages from other data. Such
  systems are PHP, ASP, JSP, Coldfusion, and others. These can all be used for
  a range of CGI-related purposes. We are going to use PHP, which is just one
  example. You are welcome to look at and compare the others if you want. (PHP
  can be used on our own server -- details follow. A Coldfusion server is operated
  by Information Services, to which access can be arranged. ASP is normally available
only on Windows-based servers, but the others are supported on various platforms.) </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>What happens with all of these systems is that you write <em>templates</em>,
  which are HTML pages that have instructions of some kind embedded in them.
  The server processes the template by removing the instructions and replacing
  them with more HTML that the instructions tell it how to create, often using
  data or other resources that may be different at different times. Hence the
  final page that the user sees is created <em>dynamically</em> just at the moment
  it is asked for, and so it can be updated in many ways that would be impossible
  with a static page.</p>
<h2>PHP</h2>
<p>We have chosen PHP mainly because it is free, open source
  software and very widely used. It is also extremely powerful. Its development
  history is well described at <a href="http://uk.php.net/manual/en/history.php">http://uk.php.net/manual/en/history.php</a>.
  It has a comprehensive manual, as well as tutorials and other material, on
  its own web site at <a href="http://uk.php.net/docs.php" target="_blank">http://uk.php.net/docs.php</a>.
  It is also well integrated with Dreamweaver for editing and design purposes.</p>
<p>You can install PHP on your own computer (e.g. laptop), along with the MySQL
  database and the Apache web server, in the form of a neatly packaged setup
  called (if you are using a Macintosh) MAMP (<a href="www.mamp.info/">www.mamp.info/</a>).
  This stands for &quot;Macintosh,
  Apache, MySQL, PHP&quot;, and derives from the original LAMP, which is for
  the Linux operating system. There is also WAMP or WampServer for Windows machines.
  We do not undertake to support students in running any setup on their own
  machines: if you wish to try it, this is up to you. We provide access to all
  the components on the studio systems, as described <a href="additional14.html" target="_blank">at this link</a>.</p>
<p>PHP defines a language written between tags that are placed within HTML pages.
  The tags open with &quot;<strong><em>&lt;?php</em></strong>&quot;, and close with &quot;<em><strong>?&gt;</strong></em>&quot;;
  they are embedded in ordinary HTML pages that are placed on a machine with
  a special PHP web server (which is often an extension of the server that serves
  plain HTML web pages). These pages are sometimes known as <i>templates</i>.
  When they are served by the server, <em>all the PHP code, with its tags, disappears</em> and
  is replaced by pieces of HTML that depend on what the PHP statements specified.
  The resulting page is therefore interpretable by any normal browser. If you
  look at the HTML source of any PHP page as it arrives at your browser, you
  wil find nothing other than ordinary HTML, CSS etc. With this kind of system,
  the pages can be designed exactly as usual, but with these PHP tags as placeholders
  for material that will be provided dynamically when the page is viewed in the
  user's browser.</p>
<p>So there is no PHP user interface: you design your page templates using Dreamweaver,
  or any other text editor, and you include PHP script elements into the HTML.
  Dreamweaver and some other editors will have functionality that helps you to
  do this, but you don't have to use it. Your template contains
  nothing but text. Then you place the templates onto the PHP server and access
  them via a web browser, like
  any other
  web pages.</p>
<p>Some of the examples used in what follows are actually based on ones in the
book <i>Programming in Cold Fusion</i> by Rob Brooks-Bilson (O'Reilly, 2001), because we originally used ColdFusion in this course,
  but they have been rewritten to use PHP. This emphasises that these systems
  all do the same thing, even if they do it in slightly different ways. There
  are many similar books on PHP, and even more material on the web — a good introduction
  can be found, as usual, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/">at w3schools.com</a>,
  but unfortunately they do not use the database connection      method that
we'll be using here (see later), so <em><strong>do not follow their examples on using databases</strong></em>.</p>
<p> There are plenty of things you can do with PHP without needing to use a database.
  Here's a simple example of a template. (Note that I am following the
  terminology of referring to the whole code of the page as a <em>template</em>;
  sometimes I might call it a <em>page</em>. I will refer to the parts <strong>within
  the PHP tags</strong> as <em>script</em> elements, or simply <em>the PHP script</em>.
  This is not necessarily the same terminology as you will find elsewhere, but
  I think it's clearer if used consistently.)</p>
<p><code>&lt;HTML&gt;<br>
  &lt;HEAD&gt;<br>
  &lt;TITLE&gt;PHP Example&lt;/TITLE&gt;<br>
  &lt;/HEAD&gt;<br>
  /&lt;BODY&gt;<br>
  &lt;H2&gt;Today's date is<br>
  </code><code>&lt;?php<br>
    echo date(&quot;d/m/Y&quot;);<br>
  </code><code>?&gt;<br>
  &lt;/H2&gt;<br>
  &lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
  &lt;/HTML&gt;</code></p>
<p>This is clearly HTML with just the embedded PHP tags. Within the scope of
  these tags, everything is taken to be PHP code that should be evaluated. In
  this case, the result of the evaluation (which is today's date) is simply inserted
  into the HTML page and handed to the user's browser. What appears on the browser
  (at the time of editing these notes) is simply:</p>
<h2>Today's date is 15/01/2014</h2>
<p>(Try <a href="http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/test/date.php" target="_blank">http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/test/date.php</a>.
  See if you can guess how to make it put the day before the month!) </p>
<p>The processing of this template is illustrated in the following diagram (click
  for larger version).</p>
<p><a href="PHP-process.png" target="_blank"><img src="PHP-process.png" width="547" height="427" alt="PHP processing diagram"></a></p>
<p class="RedText"><em>Always remember that the PHP script is only processed if the template
    is <strong>requested from the server</strong>, i.e. if you use a browser and <strong>a URL that begins with http:// </strong>...
    If you access the template file <strong>directly</strong> with a browser (in which
    case your URL will begin <strong>file://</strong>) then the script will <strong>not</strong> be processed and so you will <strong>not</strong> see the result you expect.</em></p>
<p>This is the basic idea behind PHP, which means &quot;PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor&quot;
  —  it pre-processes your web pages in various ways before they are
    served to the user. PHP has a very wide range of capabilities and can be
    used for a great many things. Here we'll talk mainly about forms and databases,
    but there is also support for email, searching, http connectivity, security
    and encryption, graphing and charting, and more advanced scripting. See the
    many books available (or the PHP web site, which has very good documentation)
    for details. Good online documentation and reference material for PHP is
    also built into Dreamweaver (<em>Reference</em> under the <em>Help</em> menu,
    then see <em>O'REILLY PHP
Pocket Reference</em>). </p>
<h2>Forms in PHP </h2>
<p>A simple example of a form that provides data which is processed and then
  just printed out (not put into a DB or anything like that) is this simple &quot;currency
  converter&quot;, which is <em>a form that gets posted to itself </em>-- a very
  useful technique in many situations. This HTML form is
  in a file called &quot;convert.php&quot;  (<span class="style10"><a href="http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/test/convert.php" target="_blank">http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/test/convert.php</a></span>):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Untitled Document&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currency converter&lt;/h2&gt;
<span class="style1">&lt;form name=&quot;form1&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;convert.php&quot;&gt;</span>
&lt;p&gt; Source currency: 
   &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;Source&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Conversion rate: 
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;Rate&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
<span class="style9">&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;Submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;&gt;</span>
&lt;/p&gt;
<span class="style8">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</code><span class="style7"><code>&lt;?php
 if (isset($_POST[&quot;Submit&quot;])) {
    $result=$_POST[&quot;Source&quot;]*$_POST[&quot;Rate&quot;];
?&gt;</code></span><code>
</code><span class="style4"><code>&lt;h2&gt;The result is: </code></span><code>
<span class="style7">&lt;?php
    echo $result;
?&gt;</span>
<span class="style4">in the target currency.&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
<span class="style7">&lt;?php
 }
?&gt;</span>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The colours are just to help me in referring to the code. Notice the use of <em>if</em> (in
  the blue part, which is the PHP script) for conditional processing: PHP has a full range of conditional
  constructions like these, which work much the same as in Actionscript, Javascript,
  or other programming languages.</p>
<p>Notice also the use of the POST method in the form action (highlighted in
  red). This makes variables that correspond to the input fields in the form
  available to the PHP template as members of the <em>$_POST</em> <strong><em>array</em></strong>,
  accessed as <em>$_POST[&quot;Submit&quot;], $_POST[&quot;Rate&quot;]</em>,
  and so on. </p>
<p>Notice that  PHP variables normally start with the character <em>$</em>.
  This is quite different from Actionscript. You don't need a keyword such as <em>var</em>,
  and the variables don't have to be declared before they are used.</p>
<p>In PHP an array may be similar to arrays in other languages, and indexed simply
  by a number, or it might be an <em>associative array</em> like the <em>$_POST</em> array
  here. In this type of array, each value is associated with a key that can be
  used to retrieve it, so here for instance the key "Rate" is associated with
  whatever value was entered by the user in the <em>Rate</em> field of the form
  we created. In PHP, the keys are strings, hence the quotes around them (which
  can be either single or double quotes). The <em>$_POST</em> array will contain
  anything the PHP script has received via an HTTP POST request, in this case
  being the material submitted from the form.
<p>Remember that when a URL appears as the <em>ACTION</em> of a form, it will
  be called as normal but given a CGI environment with the form variables in
  it. Whenever a PHP template is called as the script in a form <em>ACTION (</em>if
  the method is<em> POST</em>), a <em>$_POST</em> array is created as part of the environment.
  In that array, the item determined by the submit button in the HTML definition
  of the form (here highlighted in purple) is always defined, or &quot;set&quot;.
  In this case it's simply called <em>Submit</em> (which will be accessed as <em>$_POST["Submit"]</em>).
  Hence the <strong>function</strong> <em>isset($_POST["Submit"])</em> will return as true if and only if it
  is tested when the template is called by being the <em>ACTION</em> of a form.</p>
<p>When we simply visit the URL <a href="http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/test/convert.php" target="_blank">http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/test/convert.php</a> in
  a browser, it is not being called by a form, so <em>$_POST["Submit"]</em> is
  not <em><strong>set</strong></em>, and so nothing in the template between the opening and closing "curly
  brackets" of the PHP conditional block is processed or output: all we see is
  the form itself. But when we click on the submit button, <strong>the same URL
  is called, but this time as the form <em>ACTION</em></strong>, and so <em>$_POST["Submit"]</em> <strong><em>is
  set</em></strong>, the part of the template highlghted in blue (including the green) is processed,
  and the rest of the HTML (the statement of the result) therefore appears.</p>
<p>This technique of having the form call itself (having the form ACTION be the
  form itself) is very common and useful . However, it is also common to have
  templates that are used <em><strong>only</strong></em> as form actions, as
  pure CGI scripts, and <em><strong>never</strong></em> called directly in the
  browser -- an example, displaying the results of a database query, appears
  below.</p>
<p>Notice that, with PHP as with most other systems, there are multiple ways
  of achieving the same thing. The template we have just looked at interweaves
  PHP code and HTML in a potentially confusing way. Often, PHP developers will
  output some of the HTML from within the PHP script elements, which makes the
  overall template simpler and more compact. We could replace the whole part
  in blue and green, in the above template, with simply the following:</p>
<pre><span class="style7"><code>&lt;?php
 if (isset($_POST[&quot;Submit&quot;])) {
   $result=$_POST[&quot;Source&quot;]*$_POST[&quot;Rate&quot;];
   echo &quot;&lt;h2&gt;The result is: &quot;;
   echo $result;
   echo &quot; in the target currency.&lt;/h2&gt;\n&quot;;
 }
?&gt;</code></span></pre>
<p>Here, the PHP <em>echo</em> statements output the HTML instead of it being
  in the material outside the script. (The &quot;\n&quot; is just a new line
  in the output — not really necessary but it will make the output page HTML source more readable if you need to debug it.) One could also make this
  even more succinct by combining the three <em>echo</em> statements into one, by using
  the &quot;<em>.&quot;</em> operator (which concatenates strings in the same
  way as the <em>&quot;+&quot;</em> operator in e.g. Actionscript):</p>
<pre class="style7"><code>&lt;?php
 if (isset($_POST[&quot;Submit&quot;])) {
   $result=$_POST[&quot;Source&quot;]*$_POST[&quot;Rate&quot;];
   echo &quot;&lt;h2&gt;The result is: &quot; . $result . &quot; in the target currency.&lt;/h2&gt;\n&quot;;
 }
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Below, we will notice yet another way of obtaining the same output using the function <em>printf()</em>. It is usually the case with PHP that there are several ways of achieving the same result.</p>
<h3>The $_GET array</h3>
<p>Variables that are provided to a template in a query string as part
  of the URL (or from a form that uses the HTTP GET method) are also made very
  simply and directly available, similarly to POST variables, as members of a
  standard array called <em>$_GET</em>. Thus if we have a template called as <em>template?var=val</em> then
  in the template itself we can access <em>$_GET[&quot;var&quot;] </em>and discover
  that its value is <em>val</em>.</p>
