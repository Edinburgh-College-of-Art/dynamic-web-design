    <h1>Using a server for Dynamic Web Design</h1>
    <h2>Edinburgh Domains<br>
    </h2>
    <p>For this course, it's necessary to have access to a web server on
      which you can build your own web site using arbitrary tools. For
      this purpose, we are using "Edinburgh Domains", a service licensed
      to the University that provides each user with their own
      individual web server, and an associated domain name.</p>
    <p> This is made available through the University's EASE login
      system: to register for it you should go to <a
        href="https://edinburgh.domains/" target="_blank">https://edinburgh.domains</a>
      and click on the (not very obvious) link that says "SAML Login",
      then on the next page "Get Started". </p>
    <p> On this server, you are very much in control -- you can install
      software, change configurations, and many other things. It
      provides for using the PHP language to process server scripts, and
      it provides a MySQL database system, which we'll be using for the
      projects in this course.<br>
    </p>
    <p> This is actually a custom version of a commercial service called
      "Domain of One's Own" (DoOO) -- you'll find that some of the
      instructional material (videos) on this course were made with the
      commercial service, but the differences are minimal. Most web
      service providers, in fact, use tools and systems that are very
      similar to these, so skills that you learn with this arrangement
      will be highly transferable to other situations.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Once you're into the Edinburgh Domains system, make sure that
      you're looking at the "Dashboard". Here, you'll find links to an
      impressive array of tools that you can use to do all kinds of
      things. Specifically, we'll need to set up a database and make
      sure that we can connect to the server using a protocoal called
      SFTP. This is almost all that we'll need to do here -- most work
      with the server subsequently will be done by simply using the
      database through PHP.<br>
