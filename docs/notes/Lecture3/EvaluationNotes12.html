      <h1>Notes on Usability and Evaluation</h1>
      <h1><em>Dynamic Web Design</em></h1>
      <h3>John Lee</h3>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In this lecture, we move from looking at the
        technology for building web sites, to the various ways in which
        a web site can be evaluated. The term "usability" is employed
        here, but as noted below we interpret this fairly widely (as is
        common in the literature).</p>
      <h1>Usability &mdash; what is it?</h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal">This is sometimes surprisingly controversial.
        It has to do with how the web site and a user from the intended
        user population will work together to achieve the result the
        designer intended. This can be seen in terms of a number of
        measures, and people can disagree over their relative
        importance. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Efficiency</i><span
          style="font-style:normal"> is often seen as an obvious
          example. How many mouse clicks, etc., does it take for the
          user to get the information they need, or complete the
          operation the designer (or the designer's client) wants them
          to complete, etc.?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style:normal">Also </span><i>effectiveness</i><span
          style="font-style: normal">: how well does the site succeed in
          helping (or inducing) users to do what was wanted?<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>User
          satisfaction</i><span style="font-style:normal"> is another
          thing often measured, but often simply on the assumption that
          a satisfied user is more likely to do what the site design
          assumes they will do.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">A good many questions need to be disentangled
        when thinking about effectiveness and usability. Suppose a web
        site is intended to sell books: should its effectiveness simply
        be measured in terms of the number of books it sells? If it is
        redesigned, does the redesign stand or fall entirely on whether
        it sells more books? Does it matter whether the users now like
        the site more?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What





        if they like it more but buy less books? What if they like it
        less, but for some reason they buy more books from it? Suppose
        they do buy more books: is that because of the web site, or
        because of the sudden release of a lot of interesting books, or
        a general economic upturn, or something else?</p>
      <h1>How measure it?</h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal">From the above, we see that a whole range of
        different things might be taken as measures of usability. But
        once we have decided on which measures to use, there is still
        the question of how to obtain the values. Below, we will
        consider a range of techniques, but these can range from the
        very direct (e.g. sitting with a user and probing in detail what
        they do and how they react) to very hands-off but nonetheless
        detailed (e.g. logging the user's every action in log files via
        appropriate modification of the server and/or suitable
        javascripts etc.).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> These kinds of techniques can produce huge
        and problematic amounts of data: problematic in terms both of
        volume and of interpretation. What does the data <i>mean</i><span
          style="font-style:normal">, and how, on the basis of it, do we
          decide what to do differently in the site design? These
          questions, of course, are largely common to all computing
          applications (and a great many other things), not just web
          sites.</span></p>
      <h1>Various parameters</h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It's useful to bear in mind that the
        situation in which a web site is used is invariably a good deal
        more complex than it might look at first sight. There are a
        number of parameters that one should take into account in
        thinking about how it is used and why it is used as it is. Most
        salient among these (though by no means all of them) are the
        following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
        style="margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1
        lfo1; tab-stops:list 18.0pt"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span
          style="font-family:Symbol">*<span style="font:7.0pt
            &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span></span><!--[endif]--> <strong>Task</strong><br>
        What is the user trying to achieve? This isn't always the same
        thing as what the site design assumes the user is trying to
        achieve. Rather than buy a book, the user might be simply trying
        to find out its ISBN number. The designer might not want
        especially to help with that task, but it may still be important
        to recognise that it significantly affects the behaviour of
        users. Also, the designer might want to think about how to
        modify the user's task, e.g. by putting devices in place that
        will try to entrap the user into looking at, and perhaps buying,
        books that would otherwise have been ignored. A site that is
        purely an "information" site, not trying to sell anything (e.g.
        a museum site), might be thought to have no such hidden agenda
        to modify the user's task; but in fact such sites often have a
        hidden <i>educational</i><span style="font-style:normal">
          agenda, to "sell" a particular message or point of view on a
          topic, and the site design techniques that are needed may have
          surprising similarities to commercial sites as a result.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
        style="margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1
        lfo1; tab-stops:list 18.0pt"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span
          style="font-family:Symbol">*<span style="font:7.0pt
            &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]-->
        <strong>User</strong><br>
        Who is the user? What kind of person? All sorts of issues are
        hidden under questions like this. Is the site for children?
        Academics? The "general public"? Who are the latter?<span
          style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do they really exist?
        Is it perhaps the case that people all fall into categories that
        have significant differences in terms of their interaction with
        web sites? In that case, is <i>personalisation</i><span
          style="font-style:normal">, or </span><i>adaptivity</i><span
          style="font-style:normal"> an important feature of one's site?
          Should it show different things to different people, in
          different ways? If so, how do you determine what kind of
          person a given user is? Nowadays, an increasing amount of
          research is going into whether various measures of
          "personality" can be more or less surreptitiously deployed to
          match users to presentation styles by the use of small
          questionnaires, analysis of the user's behaviour in some
          apparently unrelated activity (playing a small game perhaps),
          etc. <br>
          <br>
          All of this tends to assume a rather dynamic site. But perhaps
          for some users, with some tasks, an entirely static site can
          be just as effective &mdash; and of course probably much cheaper to
          build. Note that users and tasks come in pairs: very often the
          same user (or kind of user, perhaps) will behave quite
          differently with a different task (or kind of task). The
          combinatorics of possibilities for adaptive sites can
          therefore become rather worrying. <br>
          <br>
          A final, <em>but by no means least important</em> issue
          concerning users is accessibility for disabled users, e.g. the
          partially sighted or colour-blind. This is something that
          should <em>always</em> be given very careful thought when
          designing a site, and the recent standards and guidelines on
          the subject give it considerable prominence. In Europe, <strong>recent
legislation






            makes accessibility a legal obligation on web sites that
            provide information</strong>, so that material provided
          graphically will have to have an alternative accessible to the
          blind, etc. (see <a href="http://www.disability.gov.uk/"
            target="_blank">http://www.disability.gov.uk/</a> for the
          legalities and <a href="http://www.w3c.org/WAI/"
            target="_blank">http://www.w3c.org/WAI/</a> for technical
          approaches to accessible web design -- a discussion at <a

            target="_blank">http://www.webcredible.co.uk/user-friendly-resources/web-accessibility/uk-website-legal-requirements.shtml</a>
          suggests that the legalities are really not very clear).</span></p>

        <strong>Social context</strong> <br>
        Recall from the topic of IT and Society that interaction with
        technology does not occur in isolation. Increasingly, of course,
        it is difficult to distinguish between web sites and information
        systems generally, since the latter are now so often sprouting a
        web-based "front end". Much depends on the social context of the
        interaction. If all the above variables are held constant (at
        least, given a typically coarse approach to categorising users
        and tasks) then one may well find that reactions to a site vary
        radically between different social settings in which the web
        site may be encountered. <br>
        <br>
        This is a major factor, when one considers that web sites are
        possibly accessed from anywhere in the world. Globalisation
        proceeds apace, no doubt, but cultural diversity is still
        blessedly rife. Desirable though this is, it can create major
        problems for the web designer, who should try to ensure that as
        far as possible his site remains accessible, usable,
        inoffensive, even attractive to the whole range of possible
        users. But not only this, the designer should perhaps also
        consider what kinds of social changes his site could bring
        about. Fanciful? Not necessarily, if one considers that the
        widespread uptake of something like online grocery shopping
        could have fairly extensive consequences, and the precise <i>ways</i><span
          style="font-style:normal"> in which it is made available could
          affect this considerably. (The designer should consider this
          if only because it may be possible to envisage that people's
          behaviour is changed by the success of the site in a way that
          makes the site itself less attractive to them.)</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Many of these issues are bound up with <i>requirements






          capture</i><span style="font-style:normal"> &mdash; a process that
          is supposed to precede design and inform with details about
          what the site or system is expected to do, for whom, and with
          what result. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style:normal">Requirements
          capture for a web site depends on addressing questions such as
          the above, to become as clear as possible about the objectives
          of the site design. Of course, these will never be completely
          precise, and will be subject to re-assessment as the design
          and deployment of the site progress.</span></p>

          button on a computer interface affords clicking, a slider

          interface affords (or in simple terms, what the user will most
          obviously try to do with it at first sight), and in particular

        techniques for evaluation. But they do set an important context
        of thinking, and a rich source of concepts, when working in this
        area.</p>
      <h1>Evaluation</h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal">By "evaluation" we mean some sort of
        procedure that a designer (or specialist evaluator) goes through
        in order to find out how a site or system measures up against
        some of the criteria we've been considering. Sometimes this is
        done by academics and consultants as research to derive general
        guidelines for site design. Here we are more concerned with its
        use by practising designers as part of the routine process of
        site design and implementation. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">A distinction is often drawn between two
        kinds (or uses) of evaluation: <i>formative</i><span
          style="font-style:normal"> and </span><i>summative</i><span
          style="font-style:normal">. Formative evaluation is
          undertaken, usually with prototypes, as part of the design
          process of a site or system, to help determine how it should
          be developed best to suit its intended users. Summative
          evaluation is applied to a finished system, after deployment,
          to find out how well it functions, and perhaps how it
          influences the culture of the organisation in which it is
          used, etc. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style:normal">Our focus
          here is naturally on formative evaluation, which is also part
          of the generic idea of </span><i>iterative system design</i><span
          style="font-style:normal">. This model assumes that design
          iterates through a series of prototypes, each being subjected
          to formative evaluation which helps to determine the design of
          the next. (Our programme for the design of an e-commerce web
          system is a simplified 2-stage iterative process, with a
          formative evaluation step between the "alpha" and "beta"
          prototypes.)</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Evaluation is in many ways closely associated
        with requirements capture, in that these should share many
        concepts about the nature of the relevant tasks, users,
        contexts, etc. A system is evaluated against the requirements it
        was supposed to meet. This process is itself iterative, and may
        lead to re-assessment of the requirements or some of the shared
        concepts. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In planning evaluation, one needs to arrive
        at some relatively settled and agreed characterisation of the
        design and requirements, etc.; but it should not be thought that
        there is any definitively <em>correct</em> description to be
        found. Requirements capture and evaluation are themselves
        processes that need to be designed for a given situation, and in
        practice have no separate "scientific" status.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Evaluation (and requirements) can be
        relatively narrow or wide in scope. For example, there can be
        more or less relative focus on cognitive or social levels.<span
          style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An emphasis on the
        social requires in-depth study of a particular, e.g.
        organisational, context.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Evaluation





        of the cognitive can be conducted in a more limited way,
        focusing on individuals and their specific interaction with the
        system.</p>

        specific issues such as:</p>

        <strong>effects of speed and irregularity</strong><br>
        What happens if the system reacts very slowly? What if it is
        sometimes slow and sometimes fast? What if certain operations
        are fast, but others are then unexpectedly slow? Can we predict
        and control the effects of such factors (which may not
        themselves be under our control) by considerations deriving from
        a <i>cognitive model</i><span style="font-style:normal"> of the
          user; i.e. an account of how the user perceives, apprehends,
          processes and provides various kinds of information? How
          important is feedback to the user during periods of
          inactivity? How critical is correct synchronisation, if

          style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&mdash; Some such questions
        can be addressed by knowing things about the ways the perceptual
        apparatus of humans processes e.g. colours and sounds. Some can

        above. Detailed techniques such as reaction-timing and even
        eye-tracking might be used in investigating these issues. <br>
        <br>
        Often there is no clear rationale, but one seems to observe that
        some things are more effective than others (on some definition
        of "effective") and often the only way to recognise this is a
        combination of intuition and experience with empirical
        observation of users in particular settings. (It's hardly ever
        possible to design much of what a real system does purely on the
        basis of theory, or even by analogy with some other situation
        one assumes to be similar. Particular situations always turn out
        to be different in unexpected ways.)</p>

          <!--[endif]--> assessment of fit with users' expectations</strong><br>
        Finally here, we note that users do not come to a system as
        blank slates, waiting for information to be fed to them. On the
        contrary, they often have very clear expectations of what a site
        will give them. These expectations may have many sources: past
        experience, books, press articles, word of mouth, etc. They form
        part of the cultural background of users in particular
        situations, and can be very hard to pin down, but they often
        will have a radical effect on how a user perceives a site. (This
        can be a worry in relation to a website that may be viewed by
        users in any part of the world, but often nothing other than
        extended experience after implementation will provide enough
        information about all these background factors.) <br>
        <br>
        No matter how well designed in theory, a site may fail compared
        to a far poorer one if it is simply much less the kind of thing
        that the users expect. The users may in such cases need to
        contribute much more effort to understand or use the site, or
        simply the look of it may put them off so that they don't even
        try. <br>
        <br>
        Usually, the effects are more subtle, however, so various
        techniques (from questionnaires to interaction with dummy sites)
        may be used to probe what users are expecting and investigate
        whether this is affecting their responses to a given design.</p>
      <h1>Techniques </h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Techniques of usability evaluation are many
        and various. However, there are a few general classes which it's
        useful to know about. Some of these we have run into already
        under IT and Society or related topics. A selection of the best
        known are as follows, but see also usability-related web sites
        and other resources (some of which are noted below):</p>

        <strong>"ethnomethodological" observation</strong><br>
        An increasingly popular technique. Ethnomethodology is at root
        the study of societies by becoming as far as possible a member
        of them and looking at them in huge detail from the "inside". In
        usability terms, this concept is always highly diluted and
        according to some purists does not really apply, but it is used
        quite commonly to refer to the detailed study of social
        situations of technology use. The evaluator will ideally work
        very intensively in an organisation for some time, and try to
        get into a position where a system being introduced can be
        looked at really from the point of view of the user, rather than
        that of the designer. This can help in identifying the nature
        and root causes of effects the technology may have within the
        organisation, but also more specifically how individuals will
        react to varying parameters of the user interaction provided by
        the system.</p>

        important, though often omitted, e.g to consider carefully how
        the user will interpret questions, and how deeply the questions
        are probing the user's experience, rather than giving them the
        opportunity to say something quickly and get away from the
        investigator! Particularly fraught, though also common, is the
        use of web-based questionnaires, where the situation in which
        they are answered is subject to no control at all.</p>

        reacting to it. This can be surprisingly effective &mdash; one might
        think that the need to talk continuously would be a distraction,
        but users often seem able after a while to "forget" that they
        are doing this. However, it's always a requirement that one try
        to show that the verbalisation is not affecting the task itself

        This is an approach favoured by many who come from a background
        in experimental psychology. The objective is often to obtain
        data that statistical techniques can be meaningfully used on
        (see next), but sometimes a more qualitative design can be used.
        In any case, the argument is that the variables relevant to
        behaviour with the system can be isolated and studied in
        separate experimental "conditions". Commonly, this is used in
        conjunction with very detailed behavioural measurements, e.g.
        "response latencies" (reaction times), and sometimes automated
        logging. (<a href="http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/">HCRC</a> has
        conducted a number of such experimental evaluations, especially
        on educational systems and systems intended to support
        collaborative work.) Usually a consequence of aiming to use
        statistics is that numbers of subjects need to be relatively
        large. There is recently a strong tendency to argue that, at
        least in formative evaluation, most of the insight can be
        obtained from a small sample, and hence just a few users will be
        enough to work with (cf "heuristic evaluation").</p>

        <strong>heavy-duty statistics</strong><br>
        Often, an argument is perceived as being stronger if it is
        founded on statistical treatments of substantial bodies of data.
        There are a large number of high-powered treatments available,
        and some can be very effective. However, a problem always arises
        with interpretation of the results, since it depends on the
        assumptions of the original experiment (e.g. that the conditions
        are genuinely independent). It happens very often that the
        situations where web sites and other systems are put into use
        are too complex for experimental conditions to be effectively
        controlled. Then, an option is to conduct the experiment under
        laboratory conditions; but now the study will often be open to
        the charge that the results will not hold when we try to apply
        them back out in the real world. This is of course a trade-off
        that affects many areas of engineering.</p>

        and often most revealing kinds of study to implement, and can be
        very useful for dealing with web sites. They will most likely
        figure prominently in the formative evaluation work of the
        class. Often they are combined with short questionnaires, given
        immediately before and after the exercise, which can help to
        establish the user's expectations and can help to find out
        various of their impressions of the experience that they had not

            the user is performing</span></strong><span
          style="font-style:normal"><br>
          It's an important point that the task of the user cannot be
          assumed to be the task the web site design anticipates. The
          user will have their own idea of what they are trying to do,
          and this may be quite difficult to pin down. Still, one has to
          try. Some of this may be addressed in a pre-session
          questionnaire. It's useful to try to identify dimensions of
          "success" in the task: what does the user think is "good", and
          why? When are they pleased with something, when not?<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This shades into

        <strong>identify positive and negative aspects of the user's
          experience</strong><br>
        The user's reactions may be exaggerated, or may (more likely) be
        subdued and subtle. In the latter case, it can be quite delicate
        to investigate shades of positive and negative aspects of the
        user's experience, but these are sometimes good guides to
        reworking of the site to achieve a much more satisfying &mdash; and
        effective &mdash; result.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
        style="margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l3 level1

        <strong>try to anticipate, but be prepared for flexibility</strong><br>
        This is perhaps very closely related to prompting without
        intruding. One should try to anticipate what the user will do,
        and how one might try to understand their reactions to various
        contingencies, but in the event the user will be in at least
        some respects fairly unpredictable. So it's important to be
        flexible enough to adapt one's line of prompting to something
        perhaps not at all anticipated by the original structure of
        ideas for prompts.</p>

      <h1>Other aspects of evaluation</h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In the above, we have concentrated on <i>"Usability"</i><span
          style="font-style:normal">. However, other things have to be
          evaluated as well. These may include </span><i>practicability</i><span
          style="font-style:normal"> and </span><i>marketability</i><span
          style="font-style:normal">. Techniques for evaluating these
          things may be specific and different from those used to assess
          usability &mdash; from software profiling to various business
          modelling techniques &mdash; but there is overlap in some areas. In
          particular, marketability and commercial viability is likely
          to relate to usability. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style:normal">Some of these
          issues can also be addressed through the use of
          questionnaires, and techniques such as "cognitive
          walk-through". This is usually a design approach which may be
          closely associated with requirements capture, based on a kind
          of think-aloud protocol using a surface-level mock-up of the
          proposed system, perhaps built using Powerpoint or Director,
          which can be helpful in addressing major issues for later
          usability evaluation.</span></p>
