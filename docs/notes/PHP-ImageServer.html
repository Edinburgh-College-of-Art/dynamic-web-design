<h1>Further PHP</h1>
<h2>An example application: the ImageServer</h2>
<p>The strategy in this example is to build an application that will allow us to upload images (or in  principle any kind of file), see the images we have uploaded, and delete them if desired. We will also want to be able to show the images as standardised thumbnails as well as at whatever size they were uploaded. To do all this, we will use a simple database to maintain information about the images. The application is complicated by the fact that for security reasons we need to store the uploaded images &quot;above the web root&quot;, where they cannot be directly accessed by potentially malicious code; but all the same we will need some way of having a URL for each image, so that we can show them on web pages.</p>
<p>As always, there are many different ways this could be done, and many different
possible architectures even for such a small application. In the chosen approach, the code is written using object-oriented syntax to organise things into classes. In this case, it's arguably unnecessary, in that we are not going to create objects as instances of the classes, but here it's partly being used as a means of keeping the code tidy.</p>
<p>The complete code can be downloaded from the main notes page, and it's best to look at the snippets discussed below in their context in the whole application. Note that the application also requires a database with a table, here called &quot;picdata&quot;, that contains the fields <em>id, picname, picfile</em> and <em>pictype</em>, which are used respectively to store an auto-incremented id, an arbitrary name or label entered by the user, the file name and the MIME type of each uploaded image. If you have any questions about any of it, do just <a href="mailto:j.lee@ed.ac.uk">email me</a>.</p>
<h3>1. The Manpics class</h3>
<p>We define the class Manpics in the included file <em>manpics.php</em>. This is a class containing properties (variables) and methods (functions) relating to managing the pictures. Here are the properties:</p>
<p>
  <span class="style2">static $imagestore=&quot;../../upload&quot;;<br />
  static $picdb=&quot;dwd11_jlee&quot;;<br />
  static $pictable=&quot;picdata&quot;;<br />
  static $thumbsize = 100;<br />
  static $connect;<br />
  static $connectionInitialised=false;</span></p>
<p>Here <em>$imagestore</em> is where we will store the image files on the server. It should be above the web root but also be somewhere where you have access to write files, which in the setup you have on playground means at the same level as your html directory. <em>$picdb</em> is just the database in which details will be kept, <em>$pictable </em>is the table in the DB, and thumbsize is the size in pixels for thumbnail images. <em>$connect</em> is the DB connection, and there's a flag we will set to tell us whether we are connected already.</p>
<p>Manpics defines a number of methods. We won't discuss <em>connectDB()</em> here, except to note that it sets <em>$connectionInitialised</em>, and then if that's true when it's called it does nothing, so it can be called at any time. Other methods include:</p>
<p>uploadPic() – which deals with uploading imagefiles<br />
  storePic() – which stores data about an image<br />
createThumbnail() – which creates a thumbnail-size copy of an image<br />
picInfoService() – a &quot;service&quot; that returns information about the images that are stored<br />
deletePicService() –  a service that deletes specified images, including their files and database data.</p>
<p>We'll discuss these as we see how they're used.</p>
<h3>2. Uploading the images </h3>
<p>The first thing the user wants to do is upload an image. So we offer a simple
  form, <em>upload.php</em> (<a href="http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/imageserver1.1/upload.php" target="_blank">http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/imageserver1.1/upload.php</a>):</p>
<p class="style2">&lt;form action=&quot;upload.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;label for=&quot;file&quot;&gt;Select a file:&lt;/label&gt;<br />
  &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;file&quot; id=&quot;file&quot; /&gt; <br />
  &lt;br /&gt;<br />
  &lt;label for=&quot;picname&quot;&gt;Picture title:&lt;/label&gt;<br />
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;picname&quot; id=&quot;picname&quot; /&gt; <br />
  &lt;br /&gt;<br />
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;<br />
&lt;/form&gt;</p>
<p>The  form is normal HTML, using an input of type <em>file</em>, which will invite the user to choose
  a file that will be uploaded and a text input that will be used simply to name
or describe the file. You'll see that the action of this form is the template itself, so the content of it continues with a PHP script. The first thing it does is include another file called<em> manpics.php</em>, which we'll look at shortly, then checks that the submit button is clicked.</p>
<p class="style2">&lt;?php<br />
  // We have to include this: &quot;require&quot; will cause a fatal error if it doesn't exist<br />
  require(&quot;manpics.php&quot;);</p>
<p class="style2">if (isset($_POST[&quot;submit&quot;])) {<br />
  echo &quot;&lt;h3&gt;Thanks for your upload ...&lt;/h3&gt;\n&quot;;</p>
<p class="style2"> // This is calling the function uploadPic that belongs to the class Manpics, as defined in manpics.php<br />
  // Input is now sanitised to prevent XSS attacks and the like ...<br />
  $picname = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'picname', FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS);<br />
  Manpics::uploadPic($_FILES[&quot;file&quot;],$picname);<br />
  echo &quot;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='viewimages.php'&gt;View images ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;;<br />
  }<br />
  ?&gt;</p>
<h3>2.1 Sanitising input</h3>
<p>The <em>filter_input()</em> function is ensuring that the variable value acquired from the form meets certain criteria. In this case, it's checking whether the variable called <em>picname</em> in the POST input (flagged as <em>INPUT_POST</em>) is <em><strong>sanitised</strong></em> (which just means &quot;cleaned up&quot;) by filtering out any &quot;special characters&quot; (i.e. <em>FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS</em>). We need to do this to avoid potential security threats, especially cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You should in fact ALWAYS use <em>filter_input()</em> when using form data, especially if you are storing the results into a database -- there are a good many filters you can choose from other than just special characters -- see <a href="http://uk1.php.net/manual/en/function.filter-input.php" target="_blank">http://uk1.php.net/manual/en/function.filter-input.php</a> and <a href="http://uk1.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.php" target="_blank">http://uk1.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.php</a>.</p>
<p>We then call the<em> Manpics::uploadPic()</em> function, which is a function defined as part of the Manpics class in the included file <em>manpics.php</em>. We give it $_FILES[&quot;file] (which is data that identifies the file selected by the user as a result of our using the form input of type <em>file</em>) and the now sanitised <em>picname</em> parameter that has come  from the form text input.</p>
<h3>2.2 Uploading</h3>
<p>In <em>manpics.php</em> there is a class containing properties (variables) and methods (functions) relating to managing the pictures. This class is called Manpics. It includes as a method the function <em>uploadPic()</em>, which we are invoking from <em>upload.php</em>. The syntax <em>Manpics::uploadPic()</em> just means call the method <em>uploadPic()</em> from the class Manpics (notice the distinction between this and calling the method in an instance of an object of that class – here we have not created a Manpics object). </p>
<p>Warning: the code for this function  looks complicated! I have colour-coded it to help identify parts of it in the following discussion.</p>
<p class="style2"> public function uploadPic($picfile, $picname) { <br />
  <span class="redCode">if ((($picfile[&quot;type&quot;] == &quot;image/gif&quot;)<br />
|| ($picfile[&quot;type&quot;] == &quot;image/png&quot;)<br />
|| ($picfile[&quot;type&quot;] == &quot;image/jpeg&quot;)<br />
|| ($picfile[&quot;type&quot;] == &quot;image/pjpeg&quot;))<br />
&amp;&amp; ($picfile[&quot;size&quot;] &lt; 200000))  {<br />
if ($picfile[&quot;error&quot;] &gt; 0) {<br />
echo &quot;Return Code: &quot; . $picfile[&quot;error&quot;] . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;<br />
}</span><br />
<span class="blueCode">else {<br />
echo &quot;Upload: &quot; . $picfile[&quot;name&quot;] . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;<br />
echo &quot;Type: &quot; . $picfile[&quot;type&quot;] . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;<br />
echo &quot;Size: &quot; . ($picfile[&quot;size&quot;] / 1024) . &quot; Kb&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;<br />
echo &quot;Temp file: &quot; . $picfile[&quot;tmp_name&quot;] . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;</span><br />
<br />
<span class="greenCode">if (file_exists(self::$imagestore . &quot;/&quot; . $picfile[&quot;name&quot;])) {<br />
$newpicfile = basename($picfile[&quot;tmp_name&quot;]).$picfile[&quot;name&quot;];<br />
}<br />
else {<br />
$newpicfile = $picfile[&quot;name&quot;];<br />
}<br />
<br />
$newpicfile = strtolower($newpicfile);  // map to lower case, avoiding problems later with recognising uppercase file extensions!<br />
$dest = self::$imagestore . &quot;/&quot; . $newpicfile;</span><br />
<span class="purpleCode">move_uploaded_file($picfile[&quot;tmp_name&quot;], $dest);<br />
echo &quot;Stored in: &quot; . $dest . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;;</span><br />
<span class="yellowCode">self::storePic($newpicfile,$picname,$picfile[&quot;type&quot;]);<br />
self::createThumbnail($dest, self::$imagestore . &quot;/&quot; .self::thumbFile($newpicfile), basename($picfile[&quot;type&quot;]));<br />
echo &quot;Thumbnail: &quot; . self::thumbFile($newpicfile) . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;;</span><br />
}<br />
} <br />
else {<br />
echo &quot;Invalid file&quot;;<br />
}<br />
}</p>
<p><span class="redCode">The first condition is just checking that the type of the file we are uploading (<em>$picfile[&quot;type&quot;]</em>) is one of a small set that we want to accept </span>(it's important for security reasons not to let the user upload just anything)<span class="redCode">, is not above a certain size, and has not already created an error</span>. <span class="blueCode">If this is all OK, we print out some details for the user </span><span class="greenCode">and then generate the pathname we want the file to have when it is stored. This is based on the name of the original image and the variable <em>self::$imagestore</em>, which is the directory (folder) in which the images will be kept.</span> Note at this point that the file is in fact <em>already uploaded</em> (if <em>$picfile[&quot;error&quot;]</em> was 0) so <span class="purpleCode">all we have to do is move it from its temporary location, which is given as<em> $picfile[&quot;tmp_name&quot;]</em>, to the place we want to keep it, which is the filename we have just generated. The moving is done using <em>move_uploaded_file()</em></span>.</p>
<p><span class="yellowCode">We then use <em>self::storePic()</em> to use the <em>storePic()</em> method of <em>Manpics</em> (which is referred to here as <em>self</em> because we are defining a method inside it) to generate database data for this image, and <em>self::createThumbnail()</em> to create and store a thumbnail version of the image</span>.</p>
<h3>2.3 Storing the image data</h3>
<p>The method <em>storePic()</em> very simply copies details of the uploaded image into a DB record:</p>
<p class="style2"> private function storePic($filename,$picname,$pictype) {<br />
self::connectDB();<br />
$q = &quot;INSERT INTO &quot;.self::$pictable.&quot;(picname,picfile,pictype) VALUES(?,?,?)&quot;;<br />
if ($stmt = self::$connect-&gt;prepare($q)) {<br />
$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&quot;sss&quot;, $picname,$filename,$pictype);<br />
$stmt-&gt;execute();<br />
$stmt-&gt;close();<br />
}<br />
}</p>
<p>– where<em> $filename</em> is the actual pathname of the file as saved, <em>$picname</em> is the name given to the picture as typed in by the user, and <em>$pictype</em> is the MIME type of the image file (e.g. jpg). Entering the image into the DB creates an <em>id</em> for it, which will be completely crucial.</p>
<h3>3. Viewing the images</h3>
<p>To view all the images we will want a template for a page on which they will all appear (as thumbnails) – this is <em>viewimages.php</em> (<a href="http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/imageserver1.1/viewimages.php" target="_blank">http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/imageserver1.1/viewimages.php</a>). </p>
<h3>3.1 Retrieving image information</h3>
<p>In here, we first query <em>Manpics::picInfoService()</em> to find out what images there are. It just returns all the data in the DB, unless it is given a non-zero ID, in which case it returns just the data for that picture:</p>
<p> <span class="style2">public function picInfoService($picID=0) {  // This means the parameter $picID is 0 by default, i.e. if it's not given any other value when the function is called<br />
self::connectDB();<br />
if ($picID == 0) {<br />
if ($result = self::$connect-&gt;query(&quot;SELECT id, picname, picfile, pictype FROM &quot;. self::$pictable))   {<br />
// We are now constructing an array to return, containing the result rows as associative arrays<br />
<span class="redCode">$ret = array(); // create an empty array<br />
while ($data = $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()) {<br />
$ret[] = $data;<br />
}<br />
return $ret;</span><br />
}<br />
}<br />
else {<br />
if ($stmt = self::$connect-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT id, picname, picfile, pictype FROM &quot;. self::$pictable . &quot; WHERE id=?&quot;)) {<br />
$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&quot;i&quot;, $picID);<br />
$stmt-&gt;execute();<br />
$stmt-&gt;bind_result($id,$picname,$picfile,$pictype);<br />
$stmt-&gt;fetch();  // There should be only one result: no loop here<br />
$arr = array(&quot;id&quot;=&gt;$id, &quot;picname&quot;=&gt;$picname, &quot;picfile&quot;=&gt;$picfile, &quot;pictype&quot;=&gt;$pictype);<br />
$ret[] = $arr;<br />
return $ret;  // An array just like the one in the other condition, but with only one row in it.<br />
}<br />
}<br />
}</span><br />
</p>
<p>The code in red is assembling an array of all the results, because <em>$result-&gt;fetch_assoc()</em> provides each row from the database in the form of an associative array, and these are collected together into a larger array, which is then what is returned to the calling point (in this case, in <em>viewimages.php</em>). In <em>viewimages.php</em> there is code to support paging of the images and so forth, but the central part of it is</p>
<p class="style2"> foreach ($picStuff as $row)  {<br />
printf(&quot;<span class="redCode">&lt;a href=\&quot;?delete=yes&amp;picID=%d\&quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;</span>\n&quot;, $row[&quot;id&quot;]);<br />
printf(&quot;<span class="blueCode">&lt;a href=\&quot;imagelocator.php?picID=%d\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;imagelocator.php?thumb=yes&amp;picID=%s\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span> %s&lt;br/&gt;\n&quot;, $row[&quot;id&quot;], $row[&quot;id&quot;], $row[&quot;picname&quot;]);<br />
}<br />
}</p>
<p>in which <em>$picstuff</em> is the array that came back from <em>picInfoService()</em> and so we are creating a series of links associated with each row of data there.<span class="redCode"> The first link is a delete link, which simply goes back to <em>viewimages.php</em> with a query string that says <em>&quot;?delete=yes&amp;picID=&quot;</em> followed by the ID of the current image</span>. (Note that there is nothing before the query in this URL, which means that it will simply link back to the same file that this code appears in, which is <em>viewimages.php</em>.) Clicking on this link will invoke the code at the top of the viewimages script, where one sees:</p>
<p class="style2">if (isset($_GET[&quot;picID&quot;]) &amp;&amp; isset($_GET[&quot;delete&quot;]))<br />
  Manpics::deletePicService($_GET[&quot;picID&quot;]);<br />
}</p>
<p>which engages the <em>Manpics::deletePicService()</em> method to delete the image and its DB record. <span class="blueCode">The second link feeds the ID of the current image to <em>imagelocator.php</em>, which is a key element in this application</span>.</p>
<h3>3.2 Displaying an image</h3>
<p>This is the part that would normally seem simple: we  just use the image URL. <em>But the images don't have a URL because they're stored above the web root!</em> The solution to this is to provide a URL that actually points to a PHP script that can behave exactly like an image. A script will seem (to the browser) to be an image if it outputs a suitable image header followed by raw image data (because this is just what the browser sees if it looks at an image file). The template<em> imagelocator.php</em> is just this kind of script: we can use it as the source parameter in an image link, e.g.:</p>
<p><span class="style2">&lt;img src=&quot;imagelocator.php?thumb=yes&amp;picID=3&quot; /&gt;</span></p>
<p>where it will seem to the browser to just be an image, in this case the thumbnail-sized version of the image with ID 3 in the database (assuming this exists, but of course we should never have an ID here for an image that doesn't exist).</p>
<p>This is achieved in the script by using <em>picInfoService() </em>again to find out the file path to the image file, then constructing an image header based on the MIME type of the file. (in the code, this is done by working back from the filename extension, but in principle it might make more sense just to get the MIME type from the DB.) Then the header is output from the function <em>ImageLocator::SendImageHeader()</em>. It's crucial that nothing else is output before this, i.e. there can be no HTML or other output of any kind from the script in this template, except for this header and then the raw image file data, which is extracted from the image file by using the built-in PHP function <em>readfile()</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>viewimages.php</em> we have therefore now generated a display of a neat set of clickable thumbnail images, each one being a link to the full-size version of the image, and each with a &quot;delete&quot; link that will allow the image, and all trace of it, to be deleted, as follows.</p>
<h3>4. Deleting an image</h3>
<p>To delete an image, we need to remove the image file, the thumbnail image file, and the related database record. This is done in <em>Manpics::deletePicService()</em>:</p>
<p class="style2">public function deletePicService($picID) {<br />
self::connectDB();<br />
<span class="redCode">if ($stmt = self::$connect-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT picfile FROM &quot;. self::$pictable . &quot; WHERE id=?&quot;)) {<br />
$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&quot;i&quot;, $picID);<br />
$stmt-&gt;execute();<br />
$stmt-&gt;bind_result($picfile);<br />
$stmt-&gt;fetch();  // There should be only one result: no loop here</span><br />
<span class="blueCode">unlink(self::$imagestore . &quot;/&quot; . $picfile);<br />
unlink(self::$imagestore . &quot;/&quot; . self::thumbFile($picfile));</span><br />
$stmt-&gt;close();<br />
}<br />
<span class="greenCode">if ($stmt = self::$connect-&gt;prepare(&quot;DELETE FROM &quot;. self::$pictable . &quot; WHERE id=?&quot;)) {<br />
$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&quot;i&quot;, $picID);<br />
$stmt-&gt;execute();</span><br />
$stmt-&gt;close();<br />
}<br />
return &quot;Deleted&quot;;<br />
}</p>
<p><span class="redCode">The DB is queried to get the data</span>, then <span class="blueCode">the builtin function <em>unlink()</em> is used to remove the image file and the thumbnail</span>, then <span class="greenCode">the database record is deleted</span>.</p>
<h3>5. Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Note that things other than images can be handled easily by changing or removing
  the restriction on file types allowed in <em>uploadPic()</em>. -- Movies, 3D models, anything you like. You might want
to have a more elaborate way of keeping track of these, though. </p>
<p>There are many aspects and elements in even this small application that haven't been mentioned here: do study the code, and raise questions about anything that's unclear (of which there will be plenty!). If using or adapting this code, you should
  certainly introduce error checking. As mentioned before, many things could have been done differently, and probably much better: this
  was was translated quickly from a ColdFusion version that was put together very quickly in the first place, and is far from perfect. You could consider many improvements -- e.g. should the thumbnails
  be created on upload or only when information is requested? Should the
material in <em>imagelocator.php</em> mostly be made into just another function in <em>manpics.php</em>? Etc.</p>
