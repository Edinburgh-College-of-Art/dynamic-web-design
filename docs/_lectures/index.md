## Course notes

Here are links to course notes, tutorials etc. Material will be updated
and extended (or cut) as required, so should not be considered as the
final version until the lecture it relates to has happened. This page
itself may well be revised as we go along.

First of all, [here is the handbookpage](http://digital.eca.ed.ac.uk/ddmhandbook/category/dynamic-web-design-p00177/).

Additionally to the lecture notes, there are:

[Some introductory talk slides (PDF)](pdf/DWD-intro14.pdf), and [a video of this talk](https://vimeo.com/125231197); This year, we are using the Fat-Free Framework for PHP (<https://fatfreeframework.com/>), normally referred to here as **_F3_**. Some of these notes are older and do not take F3 into account. This is OK, in that all the normal PHP approaches still work, but you
will not need to study (and should strictly avoid) the "vanilla PHP"
method for connecting to databases, for example.

For those who haven't looked at HTML & CSS before... you should look at
these "view-torials" as soon as possible (password is atrium):

- [HTML](https://vimeo.com/109699027)
- [CSS](https://vimeo.com/110455453)
- [Box Model](https://vimeo.com/111536732)

### Lecture notes:

1.  [Instructions for using local servers](Lecture1/additional21.html)
2.  [Introduction and Forms with F3](Lecture1/IntroAndFormsWithF3.html "Intro and Forms")
3.  [Databases with F3](Lecture1/DatabasesWithF3.html "DBs with PHP")
4.  [Jules' notes on database design](pdf/jr_DWD_dbdesign.pdf) (PDF), [the zipped source files for the blog example](zip/jr_WK03_DWD_DBTutorial.zip), and [the screencast of his tutorial](https://vimeo.com/85351919). And [further blog code](zip/jr_blog2.zip).
5.  [More PHP [updated for Fat-Free Framework]](conditionalsPHP+F3.html)
6.  [Evaluation/usability](Lecture3/EvaluationNotes12.html)
7.  Conditional expressions plus cookies / sessions: [A viewtorial on implementing login with a session in F3](https://vid-linker-dev.eca.ed.ac.uk/linker.html?v=1_b1dg98o6%7C1_ztas5fkg%7C32599141%7C2010292&p=0&cv=1_b1dg98o6%7C1_ztas5fkg%7C32599141%7C2010292&cp=0)
    -- code for this, with some additional comments, can be downloaded
    [here](FFF-SimpleExampleS.zip). The demo can be viewed and played
    with
    [here](https://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/fatfree/FFF-SimpleExampleS/)
    (with username guest, password **guest**).] This is [cookietest.php](http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/test/cookietest.php), and this is [login.php](http://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/test/login.php); [here](cookietest.txt) you can read as text the PHP file for the cookies example, and [here](login.txt) is the one for the login example. A video of a lecture about these (very poor quality) is at <https://vimeo.com/119117628>.
8.  Further PHP (and the ImageServer) **There is now a Fat-Free Framework version of the ImageServer:**
    - [here are the notes](PHP-F3-ImageServer.html)
    - [here is the zipped code](FFF-ImageServer-2.zip) Just let me know if you have any problems with this.
9.  Javascript and APIs: here are links to Jules' notes --
    <http://ddm.ace.ed.ac.uk/dynamic/apiflickr.html> There used to be notes here for the Google Maps APIs; however, Google have changed the API so these are now out of date, and Google's own notes are now much better. So just look at [the Google documentation here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).
10. [Javascript and jQuery notes](DWD-JS-jQ-notes.html)
    [Zipped code](AJAX.zip) for AJAX and jQuery examples, based on
    Jules' originals. The video of the lecture is at <https://vimeo.com/121459052>.
11. [XML](LectureXMLnotes09.html)
12. Further APIs [Notes for material on Txttools API etc](APInotesJL.html).

**Note that not all of these things will necessarily be referred to in
this year's lectures or tutorials.**

Any problems, just let me know: [John](mailto:J.Lee@ed.ac.uk).
