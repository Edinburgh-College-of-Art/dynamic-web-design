## INCLUSION

### Develop a method of gathering and displaying demographic data in an inclusive and identity positive way.

Pick an organisation that works with people from a broad range of backgrounds â€“ this can be social, political, (sub)cultural, commercial, etc. Your goal is to create a tool to gather and display information about their users in a way that doesn't alienate anyone. The means of collecting the data is as important as how you present it.

How can you capture and present user data that celebrates the many and varied characteristics of the people that engage with this organisation? What questions will you ask, and how? What methods will you use to store, query, display and compare this data?
