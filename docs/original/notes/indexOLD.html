<h1>Dynamic Web Design 2012-13 </h1>
<h2>Course notes</h2>
<p>Here are links to course notes, tutorials etc. Material will be updated and extended (or cut) as required, so should not be considered as the final version until the lecture it relates to has happened. This
  page itself may well be revised as we go along.<br />
<br />
Additionally to the lecture notes, there are:<br /> 
<a href="http://playground.ace.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/PHP-FormTutorial/">the
  PHP forms tutorial</a>,
  and <a href="http://webdbdev.ucs.ed.ac.uk/ddm/1011/CF DB Tutorial/"><br />
  </a><a href="http://playground.ace.ed.ac.uk/~jlee/PHP-DatabaseTutorial/">the
PHP database tutorial</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="Lecture1/Lecture1slides11.html">PHP/MySQL introduction</a></li>
  <li><a href="Lecture1/additional12.html">(Instructions for using local servers)</a></li>
  <li><a href="conditionalsPHP.html">More PHP</a></li>
  <li><a href="Lecture3/EvaluationNotes12.html">Evaluation/usability</a>  </li>
  <li>Defensive programming plus cookies/sessions</li>
  <li>Further PHP (and the ImageServer)<br/>
    There are actually no notes for this at present, but <a href="imageserver1.1.zip">here you can download the zipped imageserver code</a>.
    <em>This is now the improved version, &quot;imageserver1.1&quot;, which fixes security bugs detected by Geoff Lee</em>. It has many comments in it.  Note you will need to put the unzipped code into your html folder, and create a folder called "upload"
    <em> at the same level as the html folder, <strong>not</strong> inside it</em>, which your images will be uploaded into.
  Just let me know if you have any problems with this.<br />
  <a href="cookietest.php.zip">Here</a> you can also find the zipped PHP file for the cookies example. <br />

  <li>Flash Remoting<br />
  Once again, I have not been able to write up notes for this as yet (the old ColdFusion ones are useless).  
  However, 
  <a href="FlashRemotingFiles.zip">you can download from here</a> the zipped Flash and PHP files.
  The Actionscript in the DDM version of the photo gallery is well commented.
  Note the README file in the Flash folder, which contains a number of important points.
  As ever, if you have any questions, just ask.
  </li>
  <li>Further APIs<br />
  <a href="APInotesJL.html">Notes for material on Txttools API etc</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that not all of these things will necessarily be referred to in this year's
lectures or tutorials.</p>
<p>Any problems, just let me know ...<br />
