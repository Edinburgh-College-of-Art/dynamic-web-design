    <h1>Using a server for Dynamic Web Design</h1>
    <h2>Edinburgh Domains<br>
    </h2>
    <p>For this course, it's necessary to have access to a web server on
      which you can build your own web site using arbitrary tools. For
      this purpose, we are using "Edinburgh Domains", a service licensed
      to the University that provides each user with their own
      individual web server, and an associated domain name.</p>
    <p> This is made available through the University's EASE login
      system: to register for it you should go to <a
        href="https://edinburgh.domains/" target="_blank">https://edinburgh.domains</a>
      and click on the (not very obvious) link that says "SAML Login",
      then on the next page "Get Started". </p>
    <p> On this server, you are very much in control -- you can install
      software, change configurations, and many other things. It
      provides for using the PHP language to process server scripts, and
      it provides a MySQL database system, which we'll be using for the
      projects in this course.<br>
    </p>
    <p> This is actually a custom version of a commercial service called
      "Domain of One's Own" (DoOO) -- you'll find that some of the
      instructional material (videos) on this course were made with the
      commercial service, but the differences are minimal. Most web
      service providers, in fact, use tools and systems that are very
      similar to these, so skills that you learn with this arrangement
      will be highly transferable to other situations.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Once you're into the Edinburgh Domains system, make sure that
      you're looking at the "Dashboard". Here, you'll find links to an
      impressive array of tools that you can use to do all kinds of
      things. Specifically, we'll need to set up a database and make
      sure that we can connect to the server using a protocoal called
      SFTP. This is almost all that we'll need to do here -- most work
      with the server subsequently will be done by simply using the
      database through PHP.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The generic picture of the situation is like this:<br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="diagramPHP.png" height="576" width="763"></p>
    <p>The "Edinburgh Domains server" is actually a <i>host</i> that
      hosts the MySQL server as well as the web and PHP servers, so when
      you make a connection from PHP code you can connect to MySQL as on
      "localhost", which means the same host as the PHP server. However,
      if you want to connect to it from a different host, such as your
      own machine, you will need to provide the appropriate host name
      for your Edinburgh Domains MySQL server.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To access the Edinburgh Domains server, one option is work
      throught its own online Dashboard, which provides a file manager
      to manage the files you store on it, as well as management tools
      for the database server, etc. However, this is quite inconvenient
      and often we will want a more direct form of connection, which is
      done through a method called SFTP (secure file transfer protocol).
      There are many SFTP clients available, such as Cyberduck. You can
      use any of these. But also, you can make SFTP connections directly
      within PHPStorm, which allows you to manage the connection and
      your project code in a very integrated way.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Before you can access your Edinburgh Domain through SFTP, you
      have to configure it. In the Dashboard, you'll see at the very top
      of the screen, no actually on the dashboard but above the
      Edinburgh logo, a link that says "Manage you Account". On the
      drop-down menu under this, choose "User Information". Then you
      have the option to create an FTP password. It also tells you your
      username, hostname and port -- these are the crucial details,
      along with the password, that any SFTP client will need. Create a
      password, and keep a note of it (though you don't need to use it
      to create a new one if it gets lost). Then follow instructions for
      connecting with your chosen SFTP client, or (as in the
      introductory video) from inside PHPStorm.<br>
